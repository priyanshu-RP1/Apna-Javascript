//variables naming rules 

//1st - variables are case sensitive 
apple = "33 rupees "
Apple = "45 rupees "
console.log(apple)
console.log(Apple)

//both apple and Apple are seperate entities now 
//------------------------------------------------------------
//2nd only letters , digits, underscore _ , and dollar sign 
$noob3="friend"
console.log("no issues heere ", $noob3)

//3rd  only a letter , underscore_ or $ should be first letter 
// 3noob= "friend"    this will give errorr
console.log("no issues heere ", $noob3)

//4th reserved words cannot be variable names  for example console , class , and more
