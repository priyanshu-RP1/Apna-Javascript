// here we are doing types of variable declaration
// there are 3 types of variables

// once we made a variable in var, const or let it will always be in the same, !remember it

var a = 13; // i stored int in it
console.log(a);
// this is VAR type
// this can be redeclared and also updated like this

var a = "ho gaya re-declare"; // here we redeclared it
console.log(a);

// ----------------------------//
// let

let b = 7;
console.log(b);
// here we declared once but now can't redeclare it, we can just update it

// let b = 9;
// console.log("b"); // this will give error because b is already declared with let

b = 166;
console.log(b);

// ---------------------------------------------------------------

// const
// here once we declared we cannot edit or even update
// we can use this for passwords, and something like name, account registration id, complaint id, userid like this

const bb = 88;
console.log(bb);

// bb = 13; // this will give error because const cannot be reassigned
